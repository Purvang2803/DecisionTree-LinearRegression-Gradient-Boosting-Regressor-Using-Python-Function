# Model Building Notebook

Welcome to the Model Building Notebook repository! This project provides an easy-to-follow workflow for building and evaluating machine learning models, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced users.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, transform, and prepare datasets for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Implement various machine learning algorithms.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess model accuracy with clear metrics and visualizations.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Jupyter**: Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Required Python libraries (install via the `requirements.txt` file).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/model-building-notebook.git
   cd model-building-notebook
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Launch the Notebook
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "model building.ipynb"
   ```
2. Follow the steps to:
   - Load and preprocess your dataset.
   - Train machine learning models.
   - Compare model performance with metrics and charts.

## Mathematical Formulas
### Decision Tree Logic
- **Gini Index**:
  ```
  Gini = 1 - SUM(pi^2)
  ```
  Where `pi` is the proportion of samples in class `i`.

- **Entropy**:
  ```
  Entropy = - SUM(pi * log2(pi))
  ```

### Linear Regression
- **Prediction Formula**:
  ```
  y = β0 + β1 * x1 + β2 * x2 + ... + βn * xn
  ```
  Where:
  - `y` is the predicted value.
  - `β0` is the intercept.
  - `β1, β2, ..., βn` are the coefficients for features `x1, x2, ..., xn`.

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
  ```
  MSE = (1 / n) * SUM((yi - ŷi)^2)
  ```
  Where:
  - `yi` is the actual value.
  - `ŷi` is the predicted value.
  - `n` is the number of observations.

### Gradient Boosting Regressor
- **Additive Model**:
  ```
  Fm(x) = Fm-1(x) + h(x)
  ```
  Where:
  - `Fm(x)` is the model at iteration `m`.
  - `h(x)` is the new weak learner fitted on the residuals.

- **Loss Function** (commonly MSE for regression tasks):
  ```
  L = (1 / n) * SUM((yi - ŷi)^2)
  ```

## Customization
Make this project your own:
- Replace the sample dataset with your data.
- Tune hyperparameters for better model performance.
- Add additional models or metrics as needed.
